// Package local discovers agent skills that already exist on disk. It is the
// local-directory counterpart to internal/skills/geminienterprise: instead of
// fetching from the Gemini Enterprise Skill Registry, it treats a configured
// directory as a ready-made skills folder and reports what it finds.
//
// A local skills path is a parent directory containing one subfolder per skill,
// each with a SKILL.md (the same layout as examples/skills and a registry's
// target_dir). Nothing is written; the directory is used as-is.
//
// It is harness-agnostic and produces []skills.Group, so the same consumers that
// handle registry skills handle local ones.

// skipped, and any path that is missing, unreadable, not a directory, or
// contains no skills is logged and skipped so a local-skills problem never
// blocks harness creation. Paths are resolved to absolute form so the reported
